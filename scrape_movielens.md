# Scrape a website which requires login : MovieLens.org
Here we are gonna scrape a different website called [MovieLens](https://movielens.org). The important thing is that you can't access this website directly, you need to register yourself on this website.<br>
So the thing is when you try to access such website which requires login then you can't scrape it directly. You need some "cookie" or authentication tokens.<br>
The mechanism is when you try to open such websites they ask you to login. By login you tell server that you are a valid user. and then server send you website data. So to show the server that you are a valid user, your browser and server exchange an "authentication key" or "cookie". In browser this process is automatic but in Scraping we need to provide this "authentication key" / "cookie" manually.<br>
So check this following Collab notebook and don't forget to practice this code by yourself.<br>
